# Language-Translator
 Language Translator Made using HTML, CSS, JS, and fetching Google translator API.
 Learn a lot about how to add a tag inside an element using js.
 another thing is how to use the select tag and option tag.
 One main thing is how to give upload and download features on a website.
 mainly speech converting from text is a completely new thing for me but it is inbuild in javascript and it is a lot of fun.
